# React_TicTacToe

I had a tictactoe project already on my [tiny projects](https://github.com/NeoCephei/TinyProjects) repo, but I wanted to try to do it using react!

## Description 
This game is a turn around to the classic tic tac toe, is an adaptation that I saw on internet and I really wanted to play!!
Each player starts with 9 pieces, 3 small, medium and large.
You can take someone else position as long as you place a bigger piece, that brings a new level of complexity.
To make the game more dynamic each player is forced to start with small piece that can be taken later by the opponent.

## Things to do
* Create Rules Modal
* Start from random player
* Create animation to show the initial player

### Ideas
| Name      | Objective | Priority | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 2 Players     | **Make the game playable by 2 different clients** | Medium | Allow two players gamemode using p2p connection |
| Profiles     | **Create your own pieces and profile** | Low | Be able to use your own pictures for your pieces and have a profile that shows your winning rate |
| Sharing     | **Share the game and your stats** | Low | Allow the user to share their profiles or create invitation link to the app for whatsapp and telegram or generated link |
